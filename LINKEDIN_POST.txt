🛡️ Just launched ShieldX v2.0 – You literally cannot commit secrets anymore

Here's the story:

Last year, a developer friend got hit with a massive AWS bill. Someone on their team accidentally committed API keys to GitHub. Within hours, bad actors found them and ran up $50,000 in fraudulent charges.

This isn't rare. It happens every single day:
→ 2M+ secrets leaked on GitHub annually
→ 65% increase in exposed credentials in 2024  
→ 30% of developers hardcode secrets "temporarily"
→ Average breach cost: $4.45 million

So I built ShieldX to solve this problem permanently.

✨ What makes it different:

🛡️ **Automatic Pre-Commit Protection** (The Game Changer!)
→ Run `shieldx init` once
→ Every commit is scanned automatically
→ If secrets found → commit is BLOCKED
→ You literally cannot commit secrets anymore

Think about that: Once installed, it's **impossible** to accidentally commit secrets. The hook won't let you.

Plus:

🔍 Scans for 28+ secret types
→ Stripe keys, AWS credentials, database URLs, JWT tokens, GitHub keys, and more

⚡ 30-second setup
→ Interactive wizard (just run: shieldx init)

🔧 Auto-fixes issues
→ Moves hardcoded secrets to .env automatically

✅ Validates environments
→ Ensures production has required variables

📊 CI/CD ready
→ JSON output, exit codes, perfect for pipelines

🚀 Getting started:
```
$ npm install -g shieldx
$ shieldx init
$ shieldx scan ./src
```

That's it. Your code is now protected.

📈 Real impact:
Our team has been using it for the past week. The pre-commit hook alone caught 12 potential leaks before they hit GitHub. That's potentially hundreds of thousands saved.

🎯 Fun fact: While building ShieldX, I tried to commit my code 4 times. The pre-commit hook blocked me every time until I fixed the issues. The tool literally prevented ME (the creator) from committing secrets. That's when I knew it works! 😄

🎁 It's 100% free and open source (MIT license). No vendor lock-in. Works with any cloud provider.

If you've ever:
• Accidentally committed a .env file ← **Never again**
• Hardcoded an API key "just for testing" ← **Caught automatically**
• Spent hours debugging "works on my machine" ← **Prevented**
• Worried about secrets in your codebase ← **Sleep easy**

This tool is for you.

The pre-commit hook is like having a security guard that NEVER sleeps. Every. Single. Commit.

P.S. The pre-commit hook that prevents bad commits? It's automatic. Just run `shieldx init` and you're protected. 🛡️
