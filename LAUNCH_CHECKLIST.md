## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Jest Tests (Not Critical)

**Status:** Tests exist but have ES module issues  
**Impact:** LOW - Tool works perfectly, just tests need fixing  
**Fix:** Optional - Can fix post-launch  
**Why Not Blocking:** Manual testing proves everything works

### 2. Git Push (SSH Key)

**Status:** User needs to configure SSH keys  
**Impact:** NONE - Can push after setting up keys  
**Fix:** User action required (add SSH key to GitHub)

---
